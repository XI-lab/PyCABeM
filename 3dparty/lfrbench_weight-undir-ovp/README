The patch "lfrbench_weight-undir-ovp.patch" is generated for this benchmark:
https://sites.google.com/site/santofortunato/package2.tar.gz?attredirects=0
  - includes the code to generate undirected  weighted graphs with possibly overlapping communities.

The patch includes:
- Parameter "-cnl" (ommunity nodes list) added to output communities as line of
nodes to be compatible with NMI evaluation input format
- Parameters "-name" added to give custom name for the output files
- maxk is automatically decreased if required for the network generation with the specified k
(instead of the generation process termination)
